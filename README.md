## The 3 body problem:
The "Three-Body Problem" refers to a classic physics and mathematics problem that deals with predicting the motion of three celestial bodies under their mutual gravitational influence. Unlike the two-body problem, which has a well-defined solution, the three-body problem is complex and often chaotic, making it difficult to predict the exact positions and velocities of the bodies over time.

The term is also used metaphorically in discussions about complex systems, chaos theory, and even in societal contexts, such as the unpredictable interactions between different civilizations or entities. The inherent unpredictability and instability of the three-body problem serve as a powerful analogy for various challenges in science, politics, and human relationships.

This completely open source program lets us see the astrophisics problem in action using only numpy, pygame, and sys.
