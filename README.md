A simple yet efficient gravitational simulator primarly used to simulate the 
gravitational interactions between three astronomical bodies.

### A brief definition of the 3 body problem

The "Three-Body Problem" refers to a classic physics problem that deals with predicting 
the motion of three astronomical bodies under their gravitational influence. Unlike the 
two-body problem, which has a well-defined solution, the three-body problem is complex 
and often chaotic, making it difficult to predict the exact positions and velocities of 
the bodies.

The inherent unpredictability and instability of the three-body problem serves as a 
powerful analogy for various challenges in science but sometimes also politics. 
This open source program lets us visualize the astrophysics problem using the 
python programming language.
